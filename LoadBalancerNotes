Basic #LoadBalancer understanding:
A load balancer acts as the “traffic cop” sitting in front of your servers and routing client requests across all 
servers capable of fulfilling those requests in a manner that maximizes speed and capacity utilization and ensures
that no one server is overworked, which could degrade performance. If a single server goes down, the load balancer
redirects traffic to the remaining online servers. When a new server is added to the server group, the load balancer 
automatically starts to send requests to it.
