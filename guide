- Login to GCP with Google Account. 
- Create a New project if you haven't created one already. 
- Select a Project and click Continue
- Click on Compute Engine > VM instances
- Click on Create Instance 
- Give the VM instance a meaninful name. (first character must be a lowercase letter, no spaces, and all the following characters must be hyphens, 
lowercase letters, or digits, except the last character, which cannot be a hyphen.)
:My choice of name was rocky-2023
- Choose the Region and Zone
- Select Machine Type. We will select e2-medium (2 vCPU,, 1 core, 4 GB memory). If we select lower than 4 GB, our terminal commands will keep getting KILLED. 
- Click on Change under Boot disk and select "Rocky Linux" version "Rocky Linux 8 optimized for GCP". Click on Select with other. Minimum size is 20 GB.
- Under Firewall > Check "Allow HTTP traffic"
- Click on Create to create the VM- Rocky Linux 8 in GCP

# Connecting to Rocky Linux (am on MacOS)
- We can connect to the VM via command line on Terminal (macOS) or Command Prompt (Windows)
- Copy the ssh gcloud command from GCP or type in the syntax in the terminal. 
syntax looks something like this : 
	gcloud compute ssh --zone "zone-info" "name-info" --project "project-id"
 
- Once we are connected, first thing we would do is to update the machines

[bimalanemkul@rocky-2023 ~]$ sudo dnf -y update
[bimalanemkul@rocky-2023 ~]$ sudo dnf -y upgrade
